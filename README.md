# C→Rust Semantic Divergence Project

This repository studies semantic divergence between C code and its Rust translations using MTU-guided differential testing.

## Repository layout

- `docs/` — proposal and methodology notes, plus transpiler instructions.
- `projects/` — per-project workspaces (source C, translated Rust, and function-level units).
  - `projects/qsort_example/` — example project based on the C2Rust qsort demo.
    - `source/` — original C sources and build metadata.
    - `build/` — CMake build output, including `compile_commands.json`.
    - `translated/` — Rust output generated by C2Rust.
    - `functions/` — function-level units extracted for MTU-style testing (to be populated).
- `results/` — generated results, tables, and plots (initially empty).
- `scripts/` — helper scripts for build/transpile/fuzz pipelines (initially empty).
- `transpiler/` — local checkout of tooling (currently the C2Rust repo).

## Current status

- Proposal recorded in `docs/proposal.md`.
- C2Rust build/transpile steps recorded in `docs/c2rust_instruction.md`.
- Example translation produced in `projects/qsort_example/translated/src/qsort.rs`.
